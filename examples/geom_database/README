This directory contains a collection of 3d objects in "OFF" format, which
were posted to USENET by Randi J. Rost.  The program "geom3d.c" in the
parect directory is a simple filter which will read the ".geom" part of
an object, and write a correcponding wireframe 3d-plot file.

Documentation is in two files:

off.ms    - original documentation:
            To print this document, use
            pic off.ms | tbl | troff -ms

off2.ms   - documentation without "pic" macros:
            To print this document, use
            tbl off2.ms | troff -ms
