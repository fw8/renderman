C-TeX code from Chris Torek, and before him, from others.  The
attributions in this code are few and far between.  Anyway, the dirs
should be:

dev:	.dvi to RLE conversion program
** The next two directories are part of McTeX and are not included in the
** raster toolkit distribution.
h:  	Header files for the following.
lib:	C functions to handle .dvi files and fonts

You need to get the C-TeX distribution from U of Maryland in order to
use this code.  As of this writing, the latest version is available by
anonymous ftp to cs.umd.edu, in the file tex/mctex.beta.1dec89.Z This
is a compressed tar file, so be sure to use BINARY mode when
retrieving it.

You need a "fontdesc" file.  The default location is
/usr/local/lib/tex/fontdesc.  You can change this in the makefile, or
override it with a TEXFONTDESC environment variable.  Here is a
sample:

#
# Sample C-TeX font configuration file.
#
# N.B.: choose only one of `box' or `blank' TFM fonts.

# current directory always searched first
#	TYPE	SPEC	SLOP	PATH
font	gf	*	3	%f.%mgf
font	pxl	*	3	%f.%mpxl
font	pk	*	3	%f.%mpk
# this is not pretty
font	blank	*	1	i/%f.tfm
font	box	*	1	%f.tfm

#	TYPE	SPEC	SLOP	PATH
font	gf	*	3	/usr/local/lib/tex/fonts/%f/%f.%mgf
font	pxl	*	3	/usr/local/lib/tex/fonts/%f/%f.%mpxl
font	pk	*	3	/usr/local/lib/tex/fonts/%f/%f.%mpk
# SLiTeX invisible fonts can be done with links:
font	blank	*	1	/usr/local/lib/tex/slitexfonts/%f.tfm
font	box	*	1	/usr/local/lib/tex/fonts/%f.tfm
