This directory contains some random stuff that you may find useful.

colobar.sh - a shell script to generate colorbars.  The rlescale
program may do this better.

lw.map - a "gamma correction" color map for the Apple laserwriter
plus.  This was empirically determined using a reflection
densitometer.  To use it, 
	rleldmap -t .../etc/lw.map file.rle | rletops

rlesize - a script that extracts the image size from the output of
rlehdr.
